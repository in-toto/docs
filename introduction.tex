\section{Introduction}
The modern software development process is quite complex, involving a series of steps to develop it is called \textit{software supply chain}. To maintain the integrity of all the entities involved in the chain driving it into delivered product, we need to perform a holistic verification process over all of them. Our product \textit{in-toto} is the first framework that enforces this holistic verification. in-toto verifies that the steps carried out in the supply chain are exactly the same as it was laid out by a \textit{project owner} through a cryptographically signed statement \textit{link metadata} generated at each step of the chain. The link metadata ensures that the steps were performed appropriately and by the correct party in the manner specified by the layout. But what if the involved party, called \textit{functionary} is itself a compromised one? The metadata generated by such functionary cannot be trusted. So to ensure the integrity of the software stacks of the functionaries, we propose the verification with the help of Trusted Platform Module (TPM).
