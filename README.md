## Examples and Demos

There are a couple of repositories within this organization that you can use to
play around and better understand in-toto. Here's a list of them along with a
brief description.

- [demo](https://github.com/in-toto/demo): This is a very basic dummy supply
  chain example to help you understand the in-toto python toolchain. We
  recommend getting started here.
- [kubectl-in-toto](https://github.com/in-toto/kubectl-in-toto): Inside of this
  repository, you will find a demo to test a kubectl in-toto plugin to scan
  containers in your kubernetes deployment against in-toto metadata.
- [demo OpenSUSE](https://github.com/in-toto/demo-opensuse): This repository
  uses the OpenSUSE build toolchain to exemplify how in-toto could be
  integrated inside of OpenSUSE-based distros.
- [totoify-grafeas](https://github.com/in-toto/totoify-grafeas): This repository
  provides an interface that converts standard in-toto links into Grafeas
  occurrences, and back for use in an in-toto verification workflow.
- [layout-web-tool](https://github.com/in-toto/layout-web-tool): The
  layout-web-tool is a simple Flask-based web app that walks users through
  creating an in-toto layout. This tool is
  [hosted](https://in-toto.engineering.nyu.edu/) for interested project owners
  to try out.


## Other informative repositories
