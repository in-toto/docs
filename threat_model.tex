\section{Threat Model}
The goal of integration of TPMs with in-toto is to identify if any of the functionaries of the software supply chain are completely compromised. The functionary node which we assume is compromised, can happen in the following ways:
\begin{itemize}
\item[--] bootloader attack on the functionary's boot firmware
\item[--] kernel integrity attack
\item[--] file system attack
\item[--] malware spread across the network compromising the functionary.
\end{itemize}
